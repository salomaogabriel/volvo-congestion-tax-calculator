# Questions:

## Question 1

When applying the single charge rule, can it be 'stacked' and if not, what tax should be applied?
Eg: A car passes three toll stations, at 06:00, 06:58, 07:57.
When comparing the first with the second, the single charge rule apply, but, when comparing the second with
the third, the single charge rule also apply, if this pattern keeps happening, one person could pass in a lot of toll stations and only would be charged once.

What would be the best strategy in this case?

- A: Make them 'stackable' which means, that as long as they pass within 60 minutes, they're fine(situation above),
- B: Separate the single charge rule in groups, so a pass through a toll station could only belong to one group.
- C: Other

## Question 2:

This question is related to the #1 and also explains why I chose to go with option B
Should the single charge rule be applicable when the tax is equal to zero?
This example is more related to the time between days.
In case the single charge rule can be stackable, drivers could be driving while the tax is equal to zero. This way, they could keep driving for days, and only paying 18SEK.
I realized that they would be spending more money time driving around than if they paid the tax but that's not the point.

## Bonus Scenario Questions 3:

Are these different tax rules completely different (like the single charge rule) or are they just different values for the "Hours and amounts for congestion tax" table?

## Bonus Scenario Questions 4:

Would the rules also be applicable to when the taxes aren't charged (Weekends, holidays, july)

## Bonus Scenario Questions 4:

Would the rules also be applicable to vehicles eg: Motorcycles in another city might be charged.
